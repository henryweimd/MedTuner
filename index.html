          <h1><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=MedTuner">Follow @MedTuner</a></h1>

<hr><p>Think of MedTuner as a good friend, and a good listener... who happens to be a doctor.  She listens patiently to you, as a friend and you can joke, update things going on in your life, and she'll keep listening.  But she's also a doctor.  So once in a while, you'll mention something curious to her -- say, you're have a cough after taking a medication -- or you feel depressed after you just had a baby.  That's when she'll notice it and direct message you with a little note letting you know that something might be important for your health -- something you may not have realized.</p>

<p>The way to use MedTuner is to follow @MedTuner at Twitter.  This will let her follow you back, so she can start listening to the tweets.  The great news is, unlike a real doctor 1) she'll actually follow you on Twitter!, 2) she's awake 24/7 and 3) she's powered by an artificial intelligence engine that outperforms the human brain.</p>

<p>Right now we're taking MedTuner to Medical School, so to speak... and she's studying hard!  Right now we're teaching her pharmacology (fun, eh?).  But she's learning new stuff every day -- and by the way, the more friends she has, the more she learns what matters and what doesn't.  If you don't like what she's telling you, be honest with your new friend -- tell MedTuner to shut up.  She cares for you, so that means she doesn't mind good feedback.</p>
